# Oil Wells in North Dakota

Here is my code, which I used to scrape information on all the wells in North Dakota. This dataset includes the File number, CTB Number, API Number, Well Type, Well Status, Status Date, Location, Operator, Well Name, and the Field it is situated in from Township number 129 to 164. 

And here is the CSV file uploaded to a Google sheet to make your life even easier: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejBJYX8JsTNiw5IBNhwzEPqigr99IavNsEZ27aau4Gs/edit?usp=sharing

If you decide to do a story based on this data, give me a shout at (look for contact details in my GitHub profile)
